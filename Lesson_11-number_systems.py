Binary system(Base 2) - (0-1)
Octal system(Base 8) - (0-7)
Decimal system(Base 10) - (0-9)
Hexadecimal system(Base 16) (0-9 a-f)
'''
#convert decimal to binary
print(bin(25)) # > binary equivalent -> 11001
#you will get the result as 0b11001 , here 0b is just the representation for binary numbers followed by 
#the binary equivalent
print(0b101011)

#convert decimal to octal
print(oct(25))
#you will get the result as 0o31 , here 0o is just the representation for octal numbers followed by the
#octal equivalent

#convert decimal to hexadecimal
print(hex(25))
#you will get the result as 0x19 , here 0x is just the representation for hexadecimal numbers followed by 
#the hexadecimal equivalent
