#Lesson:57 -  Compiled/interpreted
'''
Python is both compiled and interpreted language

compiler converts high lavel language code into machine code
python source code first get compiled from source code into byte code and that byte code 
is interpreted in machine language..
interpreter reads line by line

Byte code is used to achieve portability
For python we have a virtual machine called pvm(python virtual machine)
on pvm we run python codes..


source code --> compiler --> Byte code --> interpreter(pvm) --> machine code
The widely used implementation of python language is cpython however there are 
other implementations as well such as pypy, ironpython, jython
